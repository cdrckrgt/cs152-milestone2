# Data descriptions

`gab_samples.txt` and `twitter_samples.txt` contain the raw text datasets.

`misclass.csv` contains the misclassified examples from both datasets.

`scraped_misclass.csv` contains new misclassified examples from other sources (mostly reddit).

`modified_misclass.csv` contains the union of the previous two misclassified example sets, modified such that our classifier works slightly better.
