MessagesJanuary 29, 2020 PublicOnce again, I (Maureen) see a Great Flame that I have come to know as the Heart of God the Father. He says: "There is a nefarious undercurrent in this effort to impeach your President.* Pray that your senators tenaciously stand for the Truth. Free will is the deciding factor in this evil effort. Much good will be accomplished if this effort is defeated. Prayer can make the difference. As with anything in this earthly existence, nothing is for certain. Therefore, pray that Truth wins out again as it did when the people elected Mr. Trump." "There are no reasons for impeachment. This effort on behalf of malcontents has cheapened the impeachment process into a political tool. Now, it would seem, no election is final." "It is not according to My Will that reputations are maligned at the whim of an ambitious few. Once again, I call for unity and peace. Do not allow factious opinions and agendas to divide. Be of one mind and one heart." * President Donald J. Trump. Read Philippians 2:1-4+ So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any incentive of love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfishness or conceit, but in humility count others better than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. + Scripture verses asked to be read by God the Father. (Please note: all Scripture given by Heaven refers to the Bible used by the visionary. Ignatius Press - Holy Bible - Revised Standard Version - Second Catholic Edition.)

Currently there is only RMS and MOS adapter but when I challenged Holosun on Facebook I got the following answer:‚ÄúIf you would first ask, you would be informed we are making adaptors for all weapon systems with manufacturers that are willing to work with us....including H&K.‚ÄùYes, I was a bit edgy in my comment. But I got a promising answer out of it. Before this comment the best I heard was that Holosun works on adaptor plates for ‚Äúall mayor gun manufacturers‚Äù which makes me wary. Especially since I only saw the optics on Glocks.I hope Holosun will keep up to their promise because from all I have seen the new Holosun 509T seem to be most interesting new red dot on the marked. I like the closed design, the 2 MOA red dot and the optional 32 MOA Circle very much.Well still a few month to go until my optical ready H&K will be delivered and if there is a proper mounting option the Holosun 509Twill be the optics I buy for it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw8V4p7MWRA#Gun #Holosun #RedDot

Furthermore, I urge you to end this Democrat attempt at disrupting the will of the American voters immediately.  It says a lot that the House Democrats voted to impeach on a purely partisan vote.  It says a lot that the House Democrats felt that they could not impeach POTUS Trump unless they curtailed full participation by the Republican House members.  It says a lot that the articles of impeachment clearly do not rise to the Constitutional description of "high crimes and misdemeanors". The House Democrats appear to have tunnel vision.  POTUS Trump has repeatedly shown that his popularity.has grown specifically due to the impeachment process.  The House Democrats, and now the Senate Democrats, wasted and are wasting taxpayer taxes by pursuing a Senate trial.  It even appears as though it will be a bi-partisan vote not to convict.  End this charade now.

http://www.fpp.co.uk/docs/Wiesenthal/LittmanMengele.htmlThe Desch√™nes Report [pp. 67-68]: The Mengele AffairThe opening paragraph of Minute-of-Council 1985-348 states:WHEREAS concern has been expressed about the possibility that Joseph Mengele, an alleged Nazi war criminal, may have entered or attempted to enter Canada;Two weeks before the passage of this Minute there had indeed been a public outcry following the publication on 23 January 1985 of an article over the signature of "Ralph Blumenthal, the New York Times." The article was captioned: "Records indicate Mengele sought Canadian visa". The third paragraph read:Other records indicate that Mengele applied to the Canadian Embassy in Buenos Aires for a Canadian visa in 1962 under a pseudonym and that the Canadians informed American intelligence officials of the attempt.One month earlier Mr. Sol Littman, Canadian representative of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, had written to the Prime Minister of Canada a letter where he unequivocally affirmed:The documents we received on Mengele, who has been the object of world-wide search since the close of WW II, produced two shocking pieces of information. [...](2) Mengele, employing the alias of Dr. Joseph Menke, applied to the Canadian embassy in Buenos Aires for admission to Canada as a landed immigrant in late May or early June, 1962.The relation between Littman's letter and Blumenthal's article is established. In the course of an interview with Commission counsel in New York, Blumenthal stated "that it was Mr. Sol Littman to whom he had been directed by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, who introduced the element of an application by Mengele to come to Canada from Buenos Aires".Littman confirmed: "I am reasonably sure that most of the information that Mr. Blumenthal printed came directly from me."

The Democrat Party is morally,  spiritually, patriotically, intellectually, logically, fundamentally, physically, pulchritudinously, bankrupt.Imagine  a political party for which the top five candidates are:Squirmy Bernie - a wealthy communist and one time Red Soviet comrade who‚Äôs still waving that banner and  who‚Äôd not one job that would have made him a millionaire (Head Start teacher,¬†psychiatric¬†aide, and carpenter).Pervy Uncle Joe - Patriarch to one of the worst (best) featherbedding families in American political history. His penchant for nuzzling females of all ages is off putting to normal people but acceptable to Democrats - the party of anything scuzzy  squalid, and skeevy.Liz ‚ÄòHeap Big LittleSquawk‚Äô Warren - an inveterate liar so lacking ANY redeeming qualities of success, leadership, gravitas, intellect, she can only seriously, truthfully promise she‚Äôd be the first woman president worthy of the strains - ‚ÄòHail to the Chief‚Äô‚Äô.Little Peter Buttigeig whose name acts also as sexual identity. Any Party that would consider yet another ponce for presidential timber is not a political Party but (butt?) a political bathhouse.Mike Bloomberg The shortest living man not from a third world hell hole. When the public sees, at the debates, that Mike doesn‚Äôt quite come up to Trump‚Äôs waist he will have lost the election then and there. Americans don‚Äôt like short people and short men even less.The Republican Party had a long history of choosing empty suits with emptier heads but they‚Äôd never gotten so low as to submit a carnival geek troupe.#Vote Republican   and   #KillThe DemocratParty

WHY SHOULD YOU REJECT ISLAM? 3Ô∏è‚É£-It teaches Muslims that they should hate us, they can deceive us, rape the women and girls, they can kill us.-It teaches that there is but ONE god and ONE valid law: Sharia.-It teaches that all Muslims are required to do whatever they can to expand Dar al-Islam (Islamic territory by whatever means (Jihad).-The endgame is Global domination!!! All mankind must convert or subjugate to Islam.
ISLAMIFICATION is taking place in Europe, Canada, USA, Australia, New-Zealand, India as we speak.Either we fight for our freedom now, or we'll lose it forever.

Sarge opens the show by covering the media push to switch concern from the corona virus to the flu saying that the latter is more deadly than the former.  It's also more lucrative for those treating people since there's a vaccine for the flu, but not for the corona virus!  Sarge gives his prescription - avoid the bad foods, get the 90 Essential Nutrients appropriate for your body weight, eat a good diet (see the GF/BF list on my website) and have colloidal silver on hand just in case.  He also gives a basic tutorial on how to make your own colloidal silver at home for pennies on the dollar!He also plugs a new website put together by on of Roger's listeners and Michael Gaddy :  https://embracingtheobvious.comwww.yourdiyhealth.comwww.midohiostemcell.comhttps://lifewave.com/cemjdrHere's the replay link:  https://castbox.fm/app/castbox/player/id1466686/id225493491?v=8.14.0&autoplay=0

THIS VIDEO IS ON A NATIONWIDE MEDIA >>>BLACK-OUT<<< PLEASE SHARE--EVERYWHERE! Look inside the mind of Antifa. For years I've been telling people that antifa is much more than just a bunch of weak, "soy boys" NO! Antifa is an organization with many tiers of authority that goes all the way up to the globalist elite. So far, we have only seen the pawns. Below I will link videos that show antifa's connections to many things you've never dreamed, and many things you underestimated them capable of. One of the most annoying things is when I hear grown men, [behind a keyboard] yelling how "they'll stomp antifa out with one hand tied behind their back!" I love them for saying they would defend us, and I'm sure I agree with these men on many topics, however, they are uninformed, misguided and ignorant. Antifa leaders are highly intelligent, well armed and well funded, do your own research if you question that. Never underestimate your enemy, that's exactly what they want you to do! Here we see part of the pawns in the antifa army working for Bernie sanders, working toward communism for America. Is this the America we want? The communist agenda for ALL our Western countries work together every day to achieve their goals, do we? Or do we depend on selected leaders to defend us and our Country? It's going to take every decent citizen of America to halt communism. We all need to be informed, and prepared. https://youtu.be/4zpCVM0delQ

The treasonist deep state is preparing for a war for when Trumps wins the election. They are lining up the pieces and setting it up to destroy our nation. They forget that 54 million US households own guns, many of them multiple guns. Most are Trump supporters. 57 Million people voted Trump in 2016, comprising the majority of the area in the US. The enemies of America by and large live in the cities, don't own guns and are confined to a small percentage of US area. As a result they can't win the fight fairly. Open borders, lying, cheating and outright high crimes are their only tactic. Because they can't win, they will call on the UN to come in and rescue them, against 54 million gun owning homes and families. Many of those 54 million are ex-military who will fight to the death against those war dodging liberal scum. We remember the price that was paid for our freedom.https://www.mintpressnews.com/media-israel-intelligence-2020-elections-cyber-security/264361/
The Matrix is a system. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.

Looks like they're backtracking on naturally getting rid of long term assets with the rise in the IOER: https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/fed-extends-temporary-repo-operations-january-least-april-hikes-ioerAs long as they don't buy anymore, this could EVENTUALLY play itself out, but there will remain demand for reserves unless the Fed Funds goes to zero.  Then the rate on excess reserves would naturally collapse with the Fed Funds.  Hopefully, that's their plan for getting rid of that program.

For more than 50 years, Nazi hunters and historians have tried in vain to discover what happened to Gestapo chieftain Heinrich Muller, who vanished in 1945 at the end of World War II.Of all the major Nazis, Muller, who was Adolf Eichmann‚Äôs immediate superior, is the most important still unaccounted for, according to numerous Holocaust experts.Now, efforts to solve the mystery are resurfacing, including attempts to answer the most provocative question of all: Was Muller briefly in U.S. custody after the war? If so, did he escape, or was he freed to become a CIA spy?Muller is officially registered as dead in Berlin. But his grave turned out to contain two unknown soldiers when it was opened more than 30 years ago. His children subsequently removed the headstone from the burial plot.U.S. Army Intelligence records indicate that Muller--who was nicknamed

Hydrogen combustion engines can be more efficient and with better emissions versus gas engines, due to the fuel differences of H2. This video will look at eight major differences between gasoline and hydrogen fuels used in internal combustion engines. This includes the combustion reaction and byproducts, air fuel ratio, ignition energy, flame velocity, auto-ignition temperature, diffusivity, quenching distance, and density. These properties result in drastic differences between using the two fuels, though both can easily be adopted and used in traditional otto-cycle piston cylinder engines, often with little modification to the existing engine hardware.Are hydrogen engines the future of internal combustion?Let's find out!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6ECwRnJ0Sg@WiIlluc20@Jemnah@leamorabito@ISA-BELLA@Thedeanno@uptheante@hartg8408@Jemima88

Ha PolitieEen tijdje geleden kwamen 2 politieagenten op bezoek op Het Masker 155 waar ik woon. Ze lieten mij op hun mobieltje een fotootje zien van een cartoon van Mohammed die ik bij een moskee in Amersfoort neergelegd zou hebben. Mensen hadden gezien dat ik op een fiets die cartoon had neergelegd. De politie wist dat ik die cartoon had gemaakt omdat mijn handtekening, logo, onder die cartoon stond. Ik zei dat ik wel cartoons van Mohammed maak en daar hebben ze een aantal van gefotografeerd. Maar deze cartoon had ik niet gemaakt en de handtekening op die cartoon was niet mijn handtekening want de v ontbrak. Ik zei dat mijn onderarm in het gips zit en hoe moet ik dan fietsend een cartoon van Mo bij een moskee neergelegd hebben? Ze geloofden mij en ze vertrokken weer. Ik heb er verder niets meer van gehoord of gelezen. Ik heb een hele tijd geleden op het politiebureau aangifte gedaan van collega Gerald van Nuil die mij op de werkplek een klap op mijn gezicht had gegeven. Hij heeft later nog twee collega‚Äôs mishandeld en werkt nou ergens anders. Hij komt niet meer terug bij ons. Daar ben ik opgelucht over. Maar vanmiddag zat ik te denken aan Gerald die mijn handtekening wel eens vervalste. Opeens viel het kwartje! Dat geintje met die cartoon van Mo bij die moskee in Amersfoort en mijn handtekening vervalsen en mij de schuld geven dat is volgens mij een streek van Gerald van Nuil uit Baarn!!!

Our FREEDOM is being attacked I wonder if anyone realizes the Gravity of what Governor Justice is suggesting. A fine gesture to be sure, but also a tragic one, in that  Northam has been so Tyrannical as to have the Governor of  West Virginia have to belly up to the bar to even suggest such a move to have the Sanctuary counties secede from the state of Virginia and its capital Richmond. The Repercussions this would have in Washington would be earth-shaking in that the US Map would have to be redrawn if this Traitor were to continue his attack on both the 1st and especially the 2nd Amendments. Thereby forcing secession. What does this say about this Heretic Northam, a man bent on discarding the Constitution as if were not worth the parchment it was written on. It is maddening in its suggestion, Frustration in its Arrogance, and deadly in its stripping of the people's rights for the We the People to keep and bear arms because this is exactly why the 2nd Amendment was written into the Constitution. We now see the foresight and genius of the framers of the Connie. They obviously knew that there would be, one day a man who would dare question the Constitution, who would dare hold it in contempt, who through his abuse of his office say Nay to the good law-abiding citizens of Virginia, and thereby force a possible conflict, as per the law of the land? Since Northam is Disregarding that law of the land the people of Virginia are well within the law to force this Charlatan to STAND DOWN, and with, I would surmise the full support of President Trump. as the We the People WOULD NOT be breaking the law.It is Northam's #1 Job to uphold the United States Constitution, yet this man looks upon it with disdain, and contempt, and therefore is to my mind a traitor and must be held accountable either by the Supreme Court, and if necessary We the People, and if it is the latter there will be a reckoning, and it will be tragic.......Just Sayin.
Our constitution needs to be protected from a tyrannical government....

Official how to switch from Windows 7 to Ubuntu Linux tutorial now availableIf you are still using Windows 7 on your computer, you are making a huge mistake. Running an unsupported operating system is pure foolishness -- there will be countless exploits in the future for which you simply won't receive patches. In other words, your data and overall online safety is now at major risk. If you insist on sticking with Microsoft's operating system, you might as well upgrade to Windows 10 -- either by installing the operating system on your current computer or buying a new PC with the OS pre-loaded. Understandably, many people are scared of Windows 10 -- Microsoft's data collection...https://betanews.com/2020/01/28/how-to-windows7-ubuntu-linux/

Vor etwa einer Stunde tauchten auf Twitter Aufnahmen eines Roh√∂ltankers vor der K√ºste des Emirats Sharjah, Vereinigte Arabische Emirate, auf.Dicker schwarzer Rauch weht aus der Mitte eines massiven Roh√∂ltankers, der vor der K√ºste festgemacht hat.Der "Vorfall" ereignete sich Stunden, nachdem die jemenitischen Houthi-Rebellen einen Raketenangriff auf eine saudische Anlage in Aramco gestartet hatten, doch ein offizieller Bericht weist darauf hin, dass Raketenabwehrsysteme die Geschosse abgefangen haben, bevor sie ihre beabsichtigten Ziele treffen konnten.Die Spannungen im Nahen Osten steigen wieder an, da das Roh√∂l in 14 Sitzungen um fast 20% oder nur um das technische Niveau der Erkl√§rung eines B√§renmarktes f√§llt, da der Ausbruch des Coronavirus in ganz China die H√§ndler eher besorgt √ºber die verringerten Nachfrageaussichten hat.√úbersetzt mit DeepLhttps://www.zerohedge.com/markets/us-navy-confirms-incident-coast-uae-oil-tanker-burns

Lay the chicken thigh fillets skin-side down and place 2 dried apricots in the middle of each. Roll the chicken around the apricots, creating a cylindrical shape, then wrap each one in a slice of Parma ham, ensuring the ham covers the seal of the chicken2Wrap each ballotine tightly in cling film, making them as neat and cylindrical as possible. Transfer to the fridge and leave for at least 1 hour to chill and set3Meanwhile, place the dried porcini in a heatproof bowl and pour over boiling water. Leave for 20 minutes to rehydrate, then drain and reserve both the liquor and the mushrooms4Place a saut√© pan over a medium heat and add a drizzle of oil. Take the ballotines out of the fridge, unwrap and fry them until crisp ‚Äì start by cooking the seam of the Parma ham, as this will help seal them, then roll them around until crisp all over. Once golden, remove from the pan and set asideimage5In the same pan, add the button onions cut-side down and cook until golden, then add the garlic and porcini mushrooms. Cook for 3 minutes, then add the white wine and scrape up any stuck bits with a spatula6Simmer the white wine until reduced by two-thirds, then add the ballotines back into the pan followed by the chicken stock, the reserved mushroom soaking liquor, any leftover apricots and the button mushrooms. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, then remove the lid and simmer for another 20 minutesimage7Once the chicken has cooked through, remove them from the sauce and set aside. If the sauce needs reducing further then cook for another 5 minutes, then add the chard leaves and stir in the cr√®me fraiche. Return the chicken to the pan, check for seasoning, finish with the chopped tarragon and bring the pot straight to the table with the cooked rice
